# Game Instructions:
At the start of every run, first click the Starter Rabbit check to get your first rabbit.
You start with no progressive stages. You don't need one to play Kingdom Outskirts, the first stage. To move on past this stage, you will need a progressive stage. You will need all 5 progressive stages to fight the final boss.

In a long run, when you get a rabbit, you can progress as far as you could with other rabbits and the checks will count again for that individual rabbit.
To get a gem check, you'll need that gem and attack type unlocked for it to be available to you.

For a short game, the goal is to beat the final boss. Once you do, click Solo Victory, then "Click to Win".
For a long game, the goal is to win with all 10 rabbits.


Long games have 33 checks each run, 330 total.
A short game will have 33 checks total, despite the tracker showing you have more. I had to do some trickery to put both runs into one apmanual.
There is a chance I'll expand the short version to 2 or 3 rabbits since a run is usually half an hour long. I'll figure something out depending on feedback and testing.

Gem checks don't appear until after you gain a Progressive Stage, as Asha doesn't first appear until the second area.
